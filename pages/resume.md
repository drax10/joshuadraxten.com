## Experience

<div class="job-header">
  <h3>👨‍💻 Full Stack Developer - Freelance</h3>
  <p>Mar 2020 - Present</p>
</div>

After working 5 years in an intense role with such a varied task list, I got burnt out and wanted to experiment with what things I enjoy working on the most. During this time I've worked on projects like:

- Building &amp; Designing Bespoke Websites (Jekyll, Eleventy and Wordpress)
- Building SaaS Apps (AWS, Node.js, React)
- Data scraping scripts (Python)
- Machine learning for a real estate start-up (Python and PostgreSQL)

Through this year I've clarified what I like working on. I love projects with a big picture goal to improve peoples lives where I can focus on perfecting the small details to get it there.

  <h3>🦊 Front End Web Developer - <a href="https://genoo.com">Genoo LLC</a></h3>
  <p>Sep 2015 - Mar 2020</p>
</div>

Genoo is half Marketing Agency half SaaS. I was hired to write HTML for emails and landing pages. In the first month I hacked together a tool to make the email templates quickly. I was then promoted to work on features for the product. In my 4+ years there, I contributed to and lead many projects:

- Design and build new UIs for building Emails, landing pages and more
- Create and support in-house themes for our clients.
- Maintaining and extending functionality to the Java Server Pages and PHP Back End - Maintain the health and consistent function of our Linux Email servers
- Create and maintain our WordPress Plugins
- Update our App's Front End to a modern React app

In my role at this job I worked with all levels of Genoo's stack to create a simple, powerful end product that creates marketing results for their users.
