## Experience

  <h3>ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Full Stack Developer - Freelance</h3>
  <p>Mar 2020 - Present</p>
</div>

After working 5 years in an intense role with a varied task list, I wanted to try different types of projects to see what things I enjoy working on the most. During this time I've worked on projects like:

- Building SaaS Apps (AWS, Node.js, React)
- Data scraping scripts (Python)
- Stock market analytics and notification tools (Python)
- Machine learning for a real estate start-up (Python and PostgreSQL)
- Building &amp; Designing Websites (Jekyll, Eleventy and Wordpress)

Through this I've learned which projects naturally motivate me to work on them and what don't. I love projects with a big picture goal to improve peoples lives where I can focus on perfecting the small details to get it there.

  <h3>ü¶ä Full Stack Developer - <a href="https://genoo.com">Genoo LLC</a></h3>
  <p>Sep 2015 - Mar 2020</p>
</div>

A small company with two devs (me and one other developer), I contributed to and lead many projects:

- Update our App's Front End to a modern React app
- Design and build new UIs for building Emails, landing pages and more
- Maintaining and extending functionality to the Java Server Pages and PHP Back End - Maintain the health and consistent function of our Linux Email servers
- Create and maintain our WordPress Plugins

In my role at this job I worked with all levels of Genoo's stack to create a simple, powerful end product that creates marketing results for our users.
