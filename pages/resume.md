## Experience

<div class="job-header">
  <h3>👨‍💻 Full Stack Developer - Freelance</h3>
  <p>Mar 2020 - Present</p>
</div>

After working in the same job for 4+ years I wanted to explore career specializations and project preferences before taking on another full-time role. During this time I've worked on projects like:

- Building &amp; Designing Bespoke Websites (Jekyll, Eleventy and Wordpress)
- Building SaaS Apps (AWS, Node.js, React)
- Data scraping scripts (Python)
- Machine learning for a real estate start-up (Python and PostgreSQL)

  <h3>🦊 Full Stack Web Developer - <a href="https://genoo.com">Genoo LLC</a></h3>
  <p>Sep 2015 - Mar 2020</p>
</div>

Genoo is half Marketing Agency half SaaS. I was initially hired to build basic HTML templates, I was promoted within two months to the dev team after automating all my tasks. Due to Genoo being a small company, I wore many hats and impacted all parts of the stack from a development and UX perspective in my 4+ years there. These projects include:

- Design and build new UIs for building Emails, landing pages and more
- Maintaining and extending functionality to the Java Server Pages and PHP Back End
- Maintain the health and consistent function of our Linux Email servers
- Create and maintain our WordPress Plugins and Themes
- Design and build websites for our clients.
- Create novel marketing tactics that converted 28% better than traditional methods in A/B tests
- Update our App's Front End to a modern React app

In my role at this job I worked with all levels of Genoo's stack to create a simple, powerful end product that creates marketing results for their users.
